Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]
Output: [4,7,2,9,6,3,1]
Example 2:


Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: [2,3,1]
Example 3:

Input: root = []
Output: []
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
