Given an array arr of integers, check if there exist two indices i and j such that :

i != j
0 <= i, j < arr.length
arr[i] == 2 * arr[j]
 

Example 1:

Input: arr = [10,2,5,3]
Output: true
Explanation: For i = 0 and j = 2, arr[i] == 10 == 2 * 5 == 2 * arr[j]
Example 2:

Input: arr = [3,1,7,11]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no i and j that satisfy the conditions.
 

Constraints:

2 <= arr.length <= 500
-103 <= arr[i] <= 103

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
