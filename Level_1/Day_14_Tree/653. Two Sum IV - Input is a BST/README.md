Given the root of a Binary Search Tree and a target number k, return true if there exist two elements in the BST such that their sum is equal to the given target.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], k = 9
Output: true
Example 2:


Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], k = 28
Output: false
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
-104 <= Node.val <= 104
root is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.
-105 <= k <= 105

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
