Given a positive integer num, write a function which returns True if num is a perfect square else False.

Follow up: Do not use any built-in library function such as sqrt.

 

Example 1:

Input: num = 16
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: num = 14
Output: false
 

Constraints:

1 <= num <= 2^31 - 1


## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
