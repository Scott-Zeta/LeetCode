An array arr a mountain if the following properties hold:

arr.length >= 3
There exists some i with 0 < i < arr.length - 1 such that:
arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]
arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]
Given a mountain array arr, return the index i such that arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1].

You must solve it in O(log(arr.length)) time complexity.

 

Example 1:

Input: arr = [0,1,0]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: arr = [0,2,1,0]
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: arr = [0,10,5,2]
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

3 <= arr.length <= 105
0 <= arr[i] <= 106
arr is guaranteed to be a mountain array.


Approach 2: Binary Search
Intuition and Algorithm

The comparison A[i] < A[i+1] in a mountain array looks like [True, True, True, ..., True, False, False, ..., False]: 1 or more boolean Trues, followed by 1 or more boolean False. For example, in the mountain array [1, 2, 3, 4, 1], the comparisons A[i] < A[i+1] would be True, True, True, False.

We can binary search over this array of comparisons, to find the largest index i such that A[i] < A[i+1]. For more on binary search, see the LeetCode explore topic here.


Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(\log N)O(logN), where NN is the length of A.

Space Complexity: O(1)O(1).

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
