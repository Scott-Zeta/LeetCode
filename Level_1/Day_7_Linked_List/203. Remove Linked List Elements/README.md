Given the head of a linked list and an integer val, remove all the nodes of the linked list that has Node.val == val, and return the new head.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,6,3,4,5,6], val = 6
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
Example 2:

Input: head = [], val = 1
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: head = [7,7,7,7], val = 7
Output: []
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 104].
1 <= Node.val <= 50
0 <= val <= 50

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
