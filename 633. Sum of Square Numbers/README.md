Given a non-negative integer c, decide whether there're two integers a and b such that a2 + b2 = c.

 

Example 1:

Input: c = 5
Output: true
Explanation: 1 * 1 + 2 * 2 = 5
Example 2:

Input: c = 3
Output: false
 

Constraints:

0 <= c <= 231 - 1


## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
