You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

 

Example 1:


Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
Example 2:

Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
Output: [0]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Approach 1: Recursion
Intuition

We can recursively define the result of a merge operation on two lists as the following (avoiding the corner case logic surrounding empty lists):

\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} list1[0] + merge(list1[1:], list2) & list1[0] < list2[0] \\ list2[0] + merge(list1, list2[1:]) & otherwise \end{array} \right.{ 
list1[0]+merge(list1[1:],list2)
list2[0]+merge(list1,list2[1:])
​
  
list1[0]<list2[0]
otherwise
​
 

Namely, the smaller of the two lists' heads plus the result of a merge on the rest of the elements.

Algorithm

We model the above recurrence directly, first accounting for edge cases. Specifically, if either of l1 or l2 is initially null, there is no merge to perform, so we simply return the non-null list. Otherwise, we determine which of l1 and l2 has a smaller head, and recursively set the next value for that head to the next merge result. Given that both lists are null-terminated, the recursion will eventually terminate.



## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
